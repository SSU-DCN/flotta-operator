## EdgeWorkload

`EdgeWorkload` is a namespaced custom resource that represents workload that should be deployed to edge devices matching criteria specified in the CR.

* apiVersion: `management.project-flotta.io/v1alpha1`
* kind: `EdgeWorkload`

### Specification

```yaml
spec:
  deviceSelector: # Specifies which EdgeDevice CRs this workload should be deployed to. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#resources-that-support-set-based-requirements
    matchLabels: # Mutually exclusive with matchExpressions
      dc: home
    matchExpressions: # Mutually exclusive with matchLabels
      - key: dc
        operator: In
        value: [home]
  type: pod # type of the workload; currently only pod is supported
  data: # See below for details
    paths:
      - source: stats # well-known "/export" container directory sub-path (/export/stats in this case) that should be periodically uploaded to the control plane   
        target: statistics # path of the directory in control plane storage where the data should be uploaded to (currently - statistics directory in edge device's OBC) 
  pod:
    spec: # Pod configuration as described in https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/
      containers:
        - name: random-server
          image: quay.io/jdzon/random-server:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              hostPort: 9090
```

#### Data Upload
Go to this document to read about the [Data Upload](data-upload.md) feature.

#### Pod specification caveats

* `containers[].envFrom` - env variables referencing is not supported
* `containers[].ports.hostPort` - has to be specified to be opened on the host and being forwarded to the `containerPort`
* only `volumes[].hostPath` and `volumes[].persistentVolumeClaim` volume types are supported
* `volumes[].hostPath.CharDevice` and `volumes[].hostPath.BlockDevice` `hostPath` volume subtypes are not supported
* **TBD**

## EdgeDeviceSet

`EdgeDeviceSet` is a namespaced custom resource that represents edge device configuration that can be assigned to multiple devices at the same time and allows for centralized configuration management.

* apiVersion: `management.project-flotta.io/v1alpha1`
* kind: `EdgeDeviceSet`
